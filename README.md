# CS152 Compiler Design Project
A project that parses and compiles source code written in the MINI-L Language <br>
by Stephanie Cabrera and Richard Duong

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>

## Phases
<br>

### Phase 1: Lexical Analysis
+ The goal of this phase is to tokenize source code written in the MINI-L language
+ We should:
  + Determine priorities in terms of types of tokens: e.g. reserved words, special symbols, etc.
  + Establish a precedence in detail for common prefixes: e.g. <, <=, and <>
  + Be able to identify and log errors from invalid tokens
  + Provide the column and character count for errors
  + Successfully output tokens from parsing the input into a file
