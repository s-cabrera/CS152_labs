by Stephanie Cabrera and Richard Duong

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>

## Phase 1: Lexical Analysis
The goal of this phase is to tokenize source code written in the MINI-L language
<br>

### Lexer Goals
+ Determine a priority for same length tokens (e.g. identifiers & keywords)
+ Be able to identify and log errors from invalid tokens
+ Provide the column and character count for errors
+ Successfully output tokens from parsing the input into a file
+ Develop and run tests on weird boundary cases and conditions

### Testing
+ Keywords
+ Operators
+ Special Symbols
+ Identifiers
+ Numbers
+ Comments
+ Errors
